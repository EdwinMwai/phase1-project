#Movie Industry Analysis

In this project my aim was to explore data from different sources and come up with insights that would help guide a person willing to venture in the movie industry. My analysis of the movie industry, achieved by garnering data and utilizing descriptive statistics and visualizations, has shown that a larger budget is correlated with a higher worldwide revenue. I have also given recommendations of the best composers  and directors.


Business Problem

my analysis is based on three main factors, which are:
    -What types of movie content are currently most successful?
    -When is the most lucrative time of year to release a movie?
    -What is the relationship between revenue and the amount used to produce a movie?

Data

The data that i used was provided to me by the TM. I imported the necessary libraries: Pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn and of course the magical line that allows plots to be displayed on my Jupyter notebook: %matplotlib inline. i then loaded my files and started cleaning the data sets.

The first step I did was explore the data to know more about it. i loaded through the pd.read_csv(‘./filename’) I ran a .head() to see the top  5 rows. This gave a chance to see the columns that I will be working with but also will give me a glance at any possible missing values.


From here I took note of which columns contained null values, placeholders, too many zeros, incorrect data types.

Data Cleaning

This was the most tedious and hectic task of all. I used different methods to deal with the missing values such as dropping rows and dropping columns.
